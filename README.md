# ðŸ“ˆ Sales Data Visualization â€“ From Rows to Revelations

This project takes the sales performance of **Hisense TVs** and **LG TVs** and transforms the raw figures into compelling visual insights using **Microsoft Excel**. Instead of getting buried in endless tables, the data is cleaned, structured, and shaped into visuals that speak for themselves.

The process started with **data cleaning**â€”removing duplicates, fixing formatting issues, and handling missing values to ensure accuracy. Once the dataset was ready, the analysis focused on comparing **monthly sales trends**, identifying **top-performing models**, and revealing demand for both brands.

For clarity and impact, the findings were visualized using **bar charts** with **legends** and **labels**. These visuals make it easy to see, at a glance, how Hisense and LG TVs perform against each other across different months in a year, and which brand dominates the market.

The goal wasnâ€™t just to make the numbers look tidy, but it was to provide decision-ready insights. Whether in a sales meeting or a business review, these charts offer a quick, accurate snapshot of performance and help guide marketing strategies, inventory planning, and promotional campaigns.
